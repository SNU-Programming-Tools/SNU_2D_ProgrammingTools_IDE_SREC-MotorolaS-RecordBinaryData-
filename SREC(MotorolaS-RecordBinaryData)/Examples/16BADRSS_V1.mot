;Comments - The SREC file format does not support comments. Some
;software ignores all text lines that do not start with "S" and
;ignores all text after the checksum field; that extra text is
;sometimes used (incompatibly) for comments. For example, the
;CCS PIC compiler supports placing a ";" comment line at the
;top or bottom of an Intel HEX file, and its manuals states
;"some programmers (MPLAB in particular) do not like comments
;at the top of the hex file", which is why the compiler has
;the option of placing the comment at the bottom of the hex file.
